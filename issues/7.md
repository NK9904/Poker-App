# Azure AI Optimization Plan

## Current Application Structure

The Poker-App is currently a well-optimized application with:

- TypeScript-based architecture
- React frontend with performance optimizations
- Web Workers for heavy calculations
- PWA capabilities
- Built-in monitoring

## Optimization Tasks for Azure AI Integration

### 1. Azure AI Service Integration

- [ ] Integrate Azure Cognitive Services SDK
- [ ] Set up Azure AI authentication and resource configuration
- [ ] Implement Azure AI service endpoints in the application
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Azure services

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement Azure CDN integration for global asset distribution
- [ ] Configure Azure Front Door for optimal routing
- [ ] Set up Azure Cache for Redis for improved performance
- [ ] Optimize API calls to Azure AI services with proper batching

### 3. Azure-Specific Features

- [ ] Implement Azure Application Insights for monitoring
- [ ] Set up Azure Key Vault for secure credential management
- [ ] Configure Azure Identity for authentication
- [ ] Add Azure SignalR Service for real-time features

### 4. AI Model Optimization

- [ ] Optimize poker calculations using Azure Machine Learning
- [ ] Implement Azure Cognitive Services for advanced analytics
- [ ] Set up model deployment pipeline in Azure
- [ ] Configure model versioning and monitoring

### 5. Infrastructure Updates

- [ ] Update deployment configuration for Azure
- [ ] Configure Azure App Service settings
- [ ] Set up Azure DevOps pipelines
- [ ] Implement Azure-specific security measures

## Technical Considerations

- Current bundle size: 572KB (can be optimized further with Azure CDN)
- Web Workers compatibility with Azure services
- PWA features integration with Azure hosting
- Performance monitoring integration with Azure tools

## Next Steps

1. Review current Azure subscription and required services
2. Create Azure resource group for the application
3. Set up development environment with Azure tools
4. Begin incremental implementation of optimizations

## Resources

- Azure AI Services documentation
- Azure optimization guides
- Azure performance best practices
- Azure deployment patterns

**Note:** Each optimization should be implemented incrementally to maintain current performance
levels while adding Azure capabilities.
