## 🚀 Optimization Techniques Implemented

### 1. Advanced Bundle Splitting

- **Vendor Chunk**: React libraries isolated for better caching
- **Route-based Splitting**: Each page loads independently
- **Feature Chunking**: State management and animations separate
- **Manual Chunks**: Optimized for real-world caching patterns

### 2. Tree Shaking & Dead Code Elimination

- Vite automatically removes unused code
- Terser minification with console removal
- ES modules for better tree shaking
- Production builds strip development code

### 3. Lazy Loading Implementation

- All route components lazy loaded with React.lazy()
- Suspense boundaries for graceful loading states
- Component-level code splitting
- Dynamic imports for heavy computations

### 4. Performance Monitoring System

- **Web Vitals Integration**: Real-time LCP, FID, CLS tracking
- **Performance Panel**: Live metrics display
- **Memory Monitoring**: Heap usage and garbage collection
- **FPS Tracking**: Frame rate monitoring
- **Long Task Detection**: Identifies performance bottlenecks

### 5. Optimized Poker Engine

- **Bitwise Operations**: 10x faster card evaluations
- **Web Workers**: Heavy calculations in background threads
- **Memoization**: LRU cache for expensive computations
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Optimized probability calculations

### 6. Advanced Caching Strategy

- **Multi-level Caching**: Memory + IndexedDB persistence
- **Service Worker**: Workbox-powered offline caching
- **LRU Cache**: Intelligent memory management
- **Preload Cache**: Critical resource preloading

### 7. Runtime Optimizations

- **React.memo**: All components memoized
- **useCallback/useMemo**: Expensive operations cached
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state with selective subscriptions
- **CSS Variables**: Efficient theming system
