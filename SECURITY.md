## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities
you find.

### How to Report

**Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of these methods:

1. **Email (Preferred)**: security@poker-ai-solver.com
2. **Private Security Advisory**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
- **Proof of Concept**: If available, include a PoC
- **Environment**: Affected versions and environments
- **Timeline**: If you plan to disclose publicly

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### Severity Levels

| Level        | Description                         | Response Time |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach  | 24-48 hours   |
| **High**     | Privilege escalation, data exposure | 1-2 weeks     |
| **Medium**   | Information disclosure, DoS         | 2-4 weeks     |
| **Low**      | Minor issues, best practices        | 1-2 months    |

## Security Best Practices

npm update

# Check outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## Security Updates

### Update Process

1. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Security issue identified
2. **Assessment**: Impact and severity evaluation
3. **Fix Development**: Security patch development
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing
5. **Release**: Security update release
6. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure with details

### Update Notifications
