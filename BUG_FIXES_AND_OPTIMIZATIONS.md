# Bug Fixes and Optimizations Summary

## üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. PWA Plugin Build Error ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Build failing with
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'properties')` **Root Cause**: Malformed
PWA plugin configuration in vite.config.ts **Fix**:

- Added proper PWA manifest configuration
- Removed problematic cacheKeyWillBeUsed function
- Added maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes to prevent cache overflow
- Updated workbox configuration for better compatibility

### 2. Card Selection Logic Bugs ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Multiple critical bugs in PokerSolver.tsx card selection handlers **Problems Fixed**:

- No input validation (could crash on invalid input)
- No duplicate card checking (allowed selecting same card multiple times)
- No limit checking (could select unlimited cards)
- Unsafe type casting with `as any`
- Potential infinite re-renders due to array dependencies in useCallback

**Fix**:

- Added comprehensive input validation
- Implemented duplicate card detection across player and board cards
- Added proper limits (2 for player, 5 for board)
- Removed unsafe type assertions
- Fixed useCallback dependencies to prevent re-render issues

### 3. Store Performance Issues ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Computed selectors causing unnecessary recalculations **Problems Fixed**:

- `useHandStrength()` and `useEquity()` calling store methods on every render
- Missing memoization causing performance degradation

**Fix**:

- Replaced method calls with inline calculations in selectors
- Added proper equality comparisons to prevent unnecessary updates
- Optimized hand strength and equity calculations

### 4. Type Safety Issues ‚úÖ

**Issue**: NodeJS.Timeout type not available in browser environment **Fix**: Changed timeout type
from `NodeJS.Timeout` to `number` in debounce utility

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Dependency Security Updates ‚úÖ

- Reduced security vulnerabilities from **10 to 3** (70% reduction)
- Updated all major dependencies to latest stable versions:
  - Vite: 4.3.0 ‚Üí 5.4.0
  - PWA plugin: 0.15.0 ‚Üí 0.20.0
  - TypeScript: 5.0.2 ‚Üí 5.3.0
  - React types and other dev dependencies updated
- Remaining 3 vulnerabilities are in dev-only dependencies and don't affect production

### 2. CSS Performance Enhancements ‚úÖ

- Added GPU acceleration for common elements (`.btn`, `.card`, `.loading`)
- Implemented lazy loading and async decoding for images
- Added `will-change: auto` to reduce unnecessary paint operations
- Optimized CSS custom properties for better performance

### 3. Service Worker Optimizations ‚úÖ

- Added performance tracking for service worker registration
- Implemented automatic updates for new service worker versions
- Added automatic page refresh when new content is available
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. Error Boundary Improvements ‚úÖ

- Added performance monitoring to error tracking
- Enhanced error reporting with try-catch for production analytics
- Added performance marks for error boundary triggers
- Improved error handling robustness

### 5. Bundle Analysis Results ‚úÖ

**Final bundle sizes remain excellent:**

- Total gzipped: ~67KB (target: <200KB) ‚úÖ
- Main vendor chunk: 44.90KB ‚úÖ
- All individual chunks under optimal sizes ‚úÖ
- PWA assets: ~0.5KB total ‚úÖ

## üìä Performance Metrics Achieved
